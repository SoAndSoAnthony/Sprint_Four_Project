# Sprint_Four_Project
 This is a sample project per assignment
 
This is the URL for this project:

https://sprint-4-project-first-draft.onrender.com/

Apparently, the plotly_express extension doesn't exist. I'm using this README text extension to document my findings.

In my Terminal in the VSCode Document, I've keyed in the streamlit run app.py command, and the result URL was this:

http://127.0.0.1:10000/

I'm looking forward to feedback in completing this Project.
