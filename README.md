# Sprint_Four_Project
 This is a sample project per assignment
 
This is the URL for this project:

https://sprint-4-project-first-draft.onrender.com/

Apparently, the plotly_express extension doesn't exist. I'm using this README text extension to document my findings.

In my Terminal in the VSCode Document, I've keyed in the streamlit run app.py command, and the result URL was this:

http://127.0.0.1:10000/

I'm looking forward to feedback in completing this Project.

UPDATE FOR PROJECT REVISION:
- Even with 'plotly.express' the app does't run. HOOWWWW?!?!
- I've updated the EDA assessment from the inital Jupyter notebook as well as the csv path into the directory, and not from my local machine.
- As I understand, the config.toml does reside within the .streamlit folder.
- Draft subject to change...

...how can you run this particular program:
- streamlit run app.py
